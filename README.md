"AI seeded" rows are flagged `_ai: true` in the locale JSON — they
were machine-translated by DeepL and await human review. Flip to
`_human: true` (or replace the entry with a plain string) once a
native speaker has approved.

The table is regenerated automatically by
[`tools/update_readme.py`](tools/update_readme.py) on every push that
touches `locales/` — do not edit it by hand.

## What this repo is

Flat JSON files, one per language. Each key is a stable identifier;
its value is the translated string. The app reads from these files at
release build time and ships them inside the binary.

```
locales/
  en.json   ← source of truth (English; managed by us)
  de.json   ← German (managed by us; we are native speakers)
  es.json   ← Spanish (community)
  fr.json   ← French (community)
  nl.json   ← Dutch (community)
```

## Improving an existing language

1. Fork this repo.
2. Edit `locales/<lang>.json`.
3. Replace `null` (or `"_ai": true` AI-seeded values) with a human
   translation.
4. Open a PR. CI checks placeholder parity, plural categories, and
   JSON schema.
5. Maintainers review and merge.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.

## Adding a new language

1. Open an issue first with the
   [new-language template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new_language.md) so
   we can confirm the locale code and add it to the app build.
2. Once approved, fork and create `locales/<code>.json` with whatever
   subset of keys you can translate. Missing keys fall back to English
   in the app — partial coverage is fine.

## How translations reach the app

- A push to `main` cuts a dated GitHub Release with a tarball of
  `locales/` and a `SHA256SUM`.
- The KiekR app build scripts fetch the latest release tarball at
  release-build time and embed it.
- We do not ship community translations to end users until they
  appear in a tagged release.

## What you cannot change here

- **`locales/en.json`** — owned by the KiekR team (the source of
  truth for every other locale).
- **`locales/de.json`** — owned by the KiekR team (we are native
  German speakers).
- **`_meta.*` fields in any file** — bookkeeping data.
- **App name "KiekR"** — non-translatable brand. Same for
  protocol tokens like `MeshCore`, `#zephyr`, region names.

CI rejects PRs that violate these.
